    <h1>Front-end developer mentorship</h1>

    <h2>Why having a mentor is important?</h2>

    <p>
      Becoming a self-taught developer is never easy. The resources we have
      available our limitless and daunting. It's information overload and it is
      hard for a newbie to navigate this landscape on your own. As a front-end
      developer mentor for the last few years, I've learnt that every student
      can benefit from a mentor no matter what kind of learning style they take.
      Since every student learns differently, no single course can teach
      everyone. Mentors apply the human touch to the process to make sure that
      information sticks.
    </p>

    <h2>What you will get from mentorship</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A one hour call every week for 4 weeks. Including pair programming and
        tailored to your needs
      </li>
      <li>Homework marked and set every week</li>
      <li>A reading list of resources curated for your level</li>
      <li>
        A private chat channel for you to contact me privately when you need an
        answer to a question
      </li>
      <li>Advice for interviews for full-time or freelance jobs</li>
      <li>Advice for working remotely</li>
      <li>
        Provide you with learning accountability (How many of you have tried and
        failed to learn from just free resources?)
      </li>
      <li>Help you to avoid the common pitfalls of learning to program</li>
      <li>
        Coach you to think like a programmer (It's hard if you've never coded
        before)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I'm Jeff. I'm a self taught developer from the UK now living in Taipei,
      Taiwan. I'm a cryptocurrency enthusiast and have been known to fly across
      the world to attend conferences. When I'm not developing or teaching, I am
      known to spend days climbing fake plastic rocks and occasionally real ones
      across the globe. I enjoy yoga, travelling and could not imagine going
      back to the office to work. There is too many amazing things to explore in
      this world and programming has enabled me to discover that. Choosing when
      and where you work is the future and we are the first generation to be
      able to choose this path. Don't waste it.

      is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing.<span>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>What is mentorship?</dt>
      <dd>
        Mentorship is similar to tutoring, but on top of tutoring you to become
        a better programmer, at the same time we are in the same industry and
        you can learn from my experience and mistakes. A tutor is teaching you a
        skill, whereas a mentor teaches you their craft.
      </dd>
      <dt>Why does mentorship cost money?</dt>
      <dd>
        A mentor is a kind of teacher, no one would expect a teacher to teach
        for free. This is a profession and good teaching deserves proper
        compensation, just as the skills I teach you will attract proper
        compensation
      </dd>
      <dt>Who is suitable for mentorship?</dt>
      <dd>
        Anyone that has a passion to learn to code and seriously wants to join
        the industry. On top of that self-drive is important as this is not a
        full-time class or course.
      </dd>
      <dt>Do I need to know programming before I can be mentored?</dt>
      <dd>
        I have experience teaching people with 0 programming experience and
        taking them to a level where they can be hired as a junior developer. I
        have also mentored students that have studied computer science and want
        to get into web development.
      </dd>
      <dt>How long is the mentorship?</dt>
      <dd>
        The mentorship periods will be for one month and can keep recurring
        until you or I decide that you no longer need my mentorship. I am always
        keeping up to date with the industry and hope to provide value wherever
        possible. I hope to bring to the level where I become obsolete.
      </dd>
      <dt>Why are you mentoring people?</dt>
      <dd>
        The best way to learn is to teach. I learn from my students everyday and
        it forces me to learn everything deeper to be able to explain things to
        someone without any experience. On top of that, I just like meeting new
        people and watching my students grow and change their lives.
      </dd>
      <dt>What makes you a good mentor?</dt>
      <dd>
        I learnt coding later in life in my 20s. I'm not a wunderkind who
        started programming on his commodore 64. And I did not study computer
        science. So if you're looking for someone that can break down the
        concepts that are so alien to the average human being, I've been through
        that process. You won't hear me use jargon and I love simple metaphors.
        It's a simple joy of teaching.
