###What am I doing right now

Updated 22 March 2018

I'm in Taipei and right now I am:

* Thinking about balance in regards to health, life and physicality
* Currently taking on students for private mentorship
* Freelancing again
* Climbing three times a week.
* Started lifting weights to balance out my muscle imbalances
* Learning VulcanJS, a GraphQL framework
* Learning GraphQL and Apollo
* Learning more about testing
* Updating my npm package with ~200k downloads a month that has been neglected for too long. A testing package called [jest-fetch-mock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-fetch-mock)
* Just bought design code book! Planning on reading one chapter per day from today
