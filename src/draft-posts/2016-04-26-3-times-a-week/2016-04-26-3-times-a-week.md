> Consistency is key.

As an avid learner, I've realised that consistency of said activity is more important than the intensity. Obviously, if you have both, nothing can stop you (*cue Don't stop me now by Queen*). However if you're like most people, you have other priorities and there's never enough ***"time"***. Well, once you've realised you do have time and you just need to reprioritise, you might end up doing something at the weekends, on a Sunday evening - sound familiar? If you only do something once a week, if you ever miss that day, you're down to once every 2 weeks automatically. And then to once a month. And then to "Oh, I can't remember the last time I...". And then it's game over.

My new rule now if I want to learn something, be something or generally succeed in something, I'm going to only do it if I can commit to at least 3 times a week. This doesn't mean if I want to write a blog post once a week, I can't do it. It means I need to be writing at least 3 times a week working on it consistently, instead of rushing to get it done at the last possible moment (which is a true story of how my last blog ended up crashing and burning). The 3 times a week doesn't mean I have to spend an entire evening on it. It can be as little as 30 minutes, or less depending on the activity. It has to be enough that I can progress in that session, but that's my only rule. You just need to pick a number and stick to it. At least for couple weeks, if it's too little or too much you can adjust, but don't change the rule every session.  

##Why 3 times a week? 

* It gives flexibility in that if I ever miss a day (for emergencies of course! ;]), I still have many more days to make it up and if I don't make it up, at least I've done it twice already that week! 
* It gives you enough time to consolidate the information without context. 
* It's not too much that you have to carve out time everyday (although more is almost always better).
* And lastly, most importantly, it creates good habits.

Everything I've ever obtained proficiency in, I had to be consistent in my learning. An intense binge session can be good to get the juices going, but at some point you need to commit to a manageable weekly (or daily) goal lest you lose the juice forever.

Carve out that 3 times week. Today.
