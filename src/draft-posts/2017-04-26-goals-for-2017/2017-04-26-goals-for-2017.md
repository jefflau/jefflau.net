In an effect to get myself back into blogging again, I'm going to do a short post on my goals for 2017.

* Climb a V10 route on the [moonboard](http://www.moonclimbing.com/)

* Build a hobby app in React Native
 * Finish the [two](https://www.udemy.com/create-your-first-react-native-app/learn/v4/) [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/v4/overview) courses I bought on React Native

* Build a Dapp in Solidity and front-end tech

* Keep up writing my blog at least once a month

* Finish the [intro to AI course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271) on Udacity

Constantly improving and making my life more and more awesome is important to me and by writing my goals out here in public I hope to motivate myself to work harder at each one. There are no lofty goals, just realistic goals that I hope to work hard towards and hopefully surpass before the year is out. To 2017, another year of learning.
