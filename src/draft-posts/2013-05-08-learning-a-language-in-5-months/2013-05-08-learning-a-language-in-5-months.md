About a month ago I did a talk at my work about learning Mandarin and learning languages in general. I try to make it as general as possible for the most part so it applies to most languages and also to just learning in general. I also recorded it so I could analyse my own public speaking in my native language, so hopefully in the future I will be able to improve! I'm hopefully going to take the notes from this talk and turn it into an indepth or several indepth articles documenting what I feel have been the most useful ways to learn a langauge that I've personally experienced.
