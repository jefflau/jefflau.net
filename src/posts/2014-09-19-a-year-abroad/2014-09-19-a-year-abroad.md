13th September 2013. The day I left the UK. 370 days I haven't been back to my home town of London. It's been an incredible journey so far and I've learnt so much about myself and how I want to live my life. And I think that's one of the most important things you will do when you travel/leave your country for a significant period of time is that you will just learn more about yourself. It was never about the destination for me, it was always about the journey and the process. And as long as you enjoy the process, it doesn't matter where you end up.

Here's a quick summary of what I've done:

London -> Abu Dhabi (transit) -> Bangkok (5 days)-> Koh Samui/Koh Phangan (1 week)-> Bangkok (transit) -> Singapore (3 days) -> Penang, Malaysia (3 days)-> Singapore (3 weeks) -> Hong Kong (3 weeks) -> Taipei, Taiwan (3 months)-> Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (transit) -> Miri, Malaysia (6 days) -> Kuching, Malaysia (3 days) -> Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (5 days) -> Singapore  (10 days) -> Taipei, Taiwan (1 month) -> Singapore  (2 weeks) -> Kuala Lumpur (1 week) -> Singapore (2 weeks) -> Taipei, Taiwan (1 month) -> Bangkok (transit) -> Phuket (1 week) -> Taipei, Taiwan (3 months) -> Hong Kong (6 days) -> Taipei, Taiwan (currently here for a couple days!)

*   Countries been to: 5
*   Tickets bought: 21 + 1 (skipped my return flight back to London)
*   Days away from London: 371

###  Where now?

I'm not sure what the future holds for me, but it looks like i'll be in Taipei at least until early next year. I need to do some freelance work so I can survive, but apart from that I got a couple cool small projects in the works!
