Here are my 5 new years resolutions for 2018.

* Become a better computer scientist
* Get more work in the blockchain space
* Build an open source project
* V10 climber on the moonboard
* Take a trip back home

## Become a better computer scientist

As a self taught programmer I have always prided myself on my tenacity and ability to learn. However there are many aspects of computer science I have chosen to ignore through lack of practicality or to some part fear. I want to counter that with some education.

### Actionable steps:
* Take at least 3 courses related to data structures, algorithms, cryptography, networking or other computer science topics

## Get more work in the blockchain space

Cryptocurrency has been the name of the game in 2017. Prices have skyrocketed and there is a lot of new opportunities in this space. In 2016 I built an account verifier for the DAOHub. In 2017 I worked on the ENS manager. In 2018 I want to spend more time in this space and build a larger portfolio of work.

* Go to at least one blockchain related meet up per month
* Go to Devcon4
* Participate in at least two blockchain hackathons

## Build an open source project
I have built two open source projects that are currently. The [ENS manager](http://manager.ens.domains) in 2017, which was funded by Nick Johnson of the Ethereum foundation and some other generous donators, as well as [Jest Fetch Mock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-fetch-mock) in 2016. Each has been an interesting programming challenge in itself, but the art of providing a resource for others to use has been a fulfilling way to give back to the community that I have taken so much from.

### Actionable steps
* Come up with at least one open source idea per week and keep them journaled
* Do at least one day a week of work on open source work

## V10 climber on the moonboard

2017 for the first half of the year I was training very hard to become a stronger climber. The later half I spent more time working on body strength and healing some injuries. I think all in all I did my best to try and get stronger, but staying healthy ultimately topped this. However in 2018 I will keep this same goal and steadily work towards it.

### Actionable steps
* Continue climbing 3 days+ per week
* Moonboard at least once per week
* Restart fingerboard training

## Take a trip back home

I haven't been back to london since Christmas 2015. It's time to take a trip back.

### Actionable steps
* Duh, book a ticket back to the UK
