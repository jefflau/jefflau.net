2019 started off in Thailand. Myself and my girlfriend went to Thailand with some friends.

I went to India for the first time and did another talk

I started routesetting

I did my first 2 V9 benchmarks on the moonboard

I did my first one arm hang on a 23mm edge

2020 goals

- Coding

  - 1 course per month (front-end masters, egghead, Kent C Dodds, or similar)
    - Every Friday morning, sit down and watch at least 1 hour of a course

- Climbing

  - Finish a benchmark V10 moonboard
  - One arm pull up
  - 1-4-7 (or equivalent)

- Routesetting
  - Average 2 routesetting jobs per month for the year
  - Make back the money for the drill and enough for a new drill
